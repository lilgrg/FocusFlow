The MVP for "FocusFlow" is meticulously designed to deliver the absolute essential core value to individuals with ADHD as quickly and effectively as possible. Its primary goal is to validate our core hypotheses about user needs and the efficacy of our unique approach, allowing us to gather crucial real-world feedback for subsequent iterations.

I. MVP Goals & Success Metrics
Core Validation: Prove that the fundamental concept of visual routine building, distraction-blocked focus, and immediate positive reinforcement genuinely helps users with ADHD manage daily tasks and focus.
User Adoption: Achieve a target number of initial downloads and active users (e.g., 1,000 active users within the first month post-beta).
Basic Engagement: Ensure users are actively using the core features, measured by:
Consistent usage of the Visual Routine Builder (e.g., users create at least 1 routine).
Regular initiation of Focus Sessions (e.g., average 3 sessions/day).
Initial positive feedback on "Dopamine Boosts" and the effectiveness of the Distraction Shield.
Technical Stability: Deliver a stable, performant, and bug-free (for core functions) initial experience to avoid early user frustration.
Feedback Loop Establishment: Successfully onboard beta testers and establish reliable channels for collecting actionable feedback.

II. Core MVP Feature Set (Focused & Lean)
The MVP will concentrate on providing a powerful, yet streamlined, set of features that directly address immediate pain points for ADHD users:
Visual Routine Builder (Basic):


Functionality: Users can create one primary daily routine. Each routine can contain a limited number of visual items (e.g., up to 10-15 per routine). Users can add custom text, select from a basic set of pre-defined icons and colors for each item.
Interaction: Simple drag-and-drop reordering within the single routine. Items can be marked as complete with a single tap.
Value: Provides essential externalized structure and reduces cognitive load for starting daily activities.
Dynamic Focus Timers (Core):


Functionality: Implements a standard Pomodoro method (e.g., fixed 25-minute focus intervals followed by 5-minute breaks).
Interaction: Simple Start, Pause, and End controls. A clear countdown timer display.
Value: Offers structured focus blocks to combat time blindness and task initiation.
Basic Distraction Shield:


Functionality: Automatically activates when a Focus Timer session begins. It will block a pre-defined, non-customizable list of common distracting apps (e.g., social media, popular games) based on system-level permissions.
Interaction: Clear visual cue when activated/deactivated. A simple, easily accessible override button (with a gentle prompt).
Value: Provides a crucial barrier against impulsivity and external distractions during focus periods.
Basic Routine Nudges:


Functionality: Time-based push notifications for routine items. Users can set a specific time for each item.
Customization: Standard notification sounds only. Basic, non-customizable reminder phrasing (e.g., "Time for your morning routine!").
Value: Externalized cues to help with time blindness and task initiation.
Basic Habit Stacking & Tracking:


Functionality: Users can define and track a limited number of simple daily habits (e.g., 3-5 habits).
Interaction: Manual check-off directly from the "Today" screen.
Value: Introduces the concept of consistent action and basic positive reinforcement for small wins.
"Dopamine Boost" Mini-Games/Rewards (Core):


Functionality: Plays a basic, pre-defined celebratory animation/visual (e.g., a burst of colorful particles, a simple satisfying sound effect) immediately upon completion of any routine item or focus session.
Value: Provides instant, positive reinforcement to strengthen desired behaviors and combat reward deficiency.
Core Navigation & Screens:


"Today" (Home) Screen: The central dashboard displaying the current routine, daily progress, and quick access to start focus sessions or complete routine items/habits.
"Focus" Screen: Dedicated interface for the active focus timer session.
Basic Habits List: A simple list view to see and check off daily habits.
Minimal Settings: Essential settings like notification preferences, basic app theme (light/dark mode).
Basic Onboarding Flow:


Functionality: A guided first-run experience that helps users create their single daily routine and try their very first focus session.
ADHD-Friendly: Designed to be minimal, interactive, and immediately showcase core value, avoiding overwhelming instructions.
Freemium Model (Basic Tier): All MVP features are part of the free tier. There will be no premium subscription or paywall within the MVP to maximize initial adoption and feedback gathering.
